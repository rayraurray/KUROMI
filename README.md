# Running the Project Application

## Using Native Python (No Virtual Environment)

To run the app without setting up a virtual environment, go to the project's root directory and run:

```bash
.\run
```

Note: Any missing dependencies will be automatically installed using `pip`.

## Using a Virtual Environment

If you prefer to use a virtual environment, navigate to the root directory and run:

```bash
.\run_venv
```
